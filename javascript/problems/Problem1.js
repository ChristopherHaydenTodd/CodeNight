/*
*    Problem 1:
*
*    Christopher Walken is known for putting his own spin
*    on how to read his lines. Specifically, he likes to
*    insert pauses, which would be denoted by a period.
*
*    Create a function that takes a string, and inserts a
*    period after each 5th word.
*
*    Since a period is being added after each 5th word, the
*    the following word should be capitalized, to add emphasis
*
*    All quotes should end with a period (If a period already
*    exists, skip to the next 5th word)
*
*    If nothing is passed, return 'More Cowbell!'
*
*    Great Example: https://vimeo.com/55624839
