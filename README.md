# CodeNight Project Readme

This project is designed for small test problems and
testing in relations to a code night scheduled for
November 3, 2016.

The ideas for these tests come from my own background
in computer science and a heaping help from sites like
https://www.codewars.com. Codewars is a great site that
helps software developers train to make themselves better,
and I would not have had the ability to put these problems
together if they had not first built there platform. I
did not take these problems from there, but they are in
line with the type of thinking that is shown on the site.

I highly recommend using sites like this occasionally to
continue evolving as a developer.

Note: This is completely open for anyone to edit, use, etc.
