    Problem 5:

    There is always money in the banana stand

    NO TOUCHING (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuHILqDIvis)

    When you have problems with money, you should always look
    in the banana stand, but we have to find it first

    Create a function that takes in a string and returns anything
    that is between the words banana and stand.

    If there is no banana and/or stand, return an string: 'No Money!'
